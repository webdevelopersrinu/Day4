1)Rules of variable declaration:-

-Begin with a letter or underscore.
-Not start with a number.
-Only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
-Be case-sensitive.
-Avoid  keywords.

2)between mutable and immutable Data types:-

mutable objects can be changed after creation, while immutable objects cannot be altered once created.

3)use of mutable and immutable Data types:-

Mutable data types are useful when you need to modify data frequently, while immutable data types provide safety and predictability in situations where you want to ensure that data remains unchanged.

4)explanation of homogeneous and heterogeneous data types:-

Homogeneous data types consist of elements that are all of the same type, while heterogeneous data types contain elements of different types.

5)list date type in python:-

A list in Python is a collection of items that can be of heterogeneous data types and can be modified.

6)list date type in python:-

In Python, arrays are data structures used to store collections of items of the same type, providing efficient storage and access to elements.

7)some useful methods for arrays and lists in Python:-

- append():Adds an element to the end of the list.
- extend():Appends elements from another list to the current list.
- insert():Inserts an element at a specified position.
- remove():Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.
- pop(): Removes and returns the element at the specified position, or the last element if no position is specified.
- index():Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.
-count():Returns the number of occurrences of a specified value.
- sort():Sorts the list.
- reverse():Reverses the order of the list.

Each method serves a specific purpose, aiding in the manipulation and management of arrays and lists in Python.
